##### Float Tetris (or Newtonian Tetris)
In normal Tetris ("integer" Tetris?), executing an action causes the tetromino to perform that action in its entirety and then (if we imagine that action as motion) come to a complete stop. 

In Float/Newtonian Tetris, this is no longer true. Actions are now gradual and partial. When a block drops, it doesn't drop by a full row and then stop. It will drop by, say, 0.1 of a row. When it rotates, it won't rotate a full 90 degrees and then stop. It will rotate, say, 1 degree.

Even worse, actions don't directly move the block. They apply force, adding a momentum that results in directional movement or rotation. The longer the player performs the action, the more momentum the block gains. Like all objects that have momentum, a tetromino in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. In other words, the player can halt an action only by applying force in the opposite direction.

The active block falls automatically, as in regular Tetris. This, too, adds momentum, so that blocks fall faster and faster as they reach the bottom of the playfield. The player will be able to apply upward force, slowing but not halting its descent. The higher the level, the higher the minimum speed of descent.

Collisions will cause bounce and collisions at high enough speeds will deform tetrominos (changing their shape) and/or move squares already settled at the bottom of the playfield. This makes "smashing" blocks against a wall or the bottom row a viable strategy.

Float Mode offers the possibility of a particularly fun, vicious competitive mode. If players use a cursor to apply force, then they could move their cursor to the opposing player's playfield and apply force there as well. Thus, in a two player game, once one player is sure his/her block is traveling in the desired direction and will land with the desired speed, that player can move his/her cursor to the opposing playfield and try to interfere.

#### Tank Tetris
In Tank Tetris, blocks move like tanks: they can rotate and move forward or backward, but the direction of "forward" and "backward" depends on the direction the block is facing. This should be challenging for experienced Tetris players, especially when combined with float/newtonian mode.

#### Asteroids/Geometry Wars Mode
Evade enemies/obstacles. If one collides with the blocks the that player is controlling, it (and the player) suffer damage. I think this would pair well with a competitive mode that allows players to add or transfer enemies and obstacles to the opponents' playfield.

#### Capablanca Mode
The board always appears to be empty, because settled blocks are invisible. Good luck memorizing the playfield!

#### Drunken-Master Mode
Double vision, wavy vision, a slowly spinning playfield, and controls that are less accurate and sometimes inverted. May cause dizziness or motion sickness. Safe with most medications.

#### Archery Mode
Turn the playfield 90 or so degrees. Notch your blocks in what used to be the line that draws the top border of the playfield. Draw it back like a bow string. Launch. Savor mayhem.
